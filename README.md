## Introduction
This project uses machine learning techniques, including K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to group cryptocurrencies based on market data. It visualizes clustering results to uncover market behavior patterns.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:jananaum7/CryptoClustering.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - sklearn
       - KMeans (For clustering cryptocurrencies.)
       - PCA (To simplify the visualizations.)
       - StandardScaler (Normalize data scale.)
     
## Usage

1. Clone repository to local machine, as seen in the installation section.
2. Open the project in VSCode.
3. Copy the starter code from Module 19 into the homework folder.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook in VSCode:
5. Use the Jupyter extension for VSCode to run the notebook cells.
6. Edit and save work.

     - My final Elbow Curve comparison demonstrates whether the optimal value for \( k \) remains 4 when comparing the original data to the PCA-transformed data.

     - This is my scatter plot for my cryptocurrency comparison. This plot visualizes cryptocurrency clusters based on two principal components, with points colored to indicate distinct clusters identified during analysis.
